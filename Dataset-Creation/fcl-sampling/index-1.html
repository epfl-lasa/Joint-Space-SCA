<p>Usage is described below:
As we have 10 submodels to describe self-collsions for humanoid robot iCub,
we need to generate 10 datasets.
To generate 100000 datapoints for specific model (let's say 1 - describing both arms), one should launch "./main 1 100000", so first parameter specifies submodel number, and second - desired size of the dataset. Code is not parallelized, but it can be achieved by launching multiple instances in two terminals, ./main 1 100000 + ./main 1 100000 will generate two separate datasets of 100k size, which can later be merged into single dataset on the processing stage. That is of course a dirty solution. </p>
