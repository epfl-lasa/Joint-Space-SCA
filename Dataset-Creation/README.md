Creating a dataset of collided/uncollided iCub postures requires two steps:
1) Sample data from SDFAST iCub model via FCL collision detection library (folder `fcl-sampling`)
2) Converting resulting binary data files into .txt formatted for libSVM (folder `data-processing`)
Instructions for each step are provided in `README.md` files in corresponding folders.
