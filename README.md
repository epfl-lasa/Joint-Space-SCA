# Steps to reproduce the results shown in the video:
1. Create dataset of sampled postures (or use provided data) - folder `dataset-creation`
2. Learn SCA model via SVM/NN (or use provided models)  - folder `sca-model-learning`
3. Launch Simulation - folder `simulation`

Instructions for each step are located in the folders. For any questions please contact Michael Koptev (mikhail.koptev AT epfl dot ch).
