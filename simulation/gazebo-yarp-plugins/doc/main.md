=====================

The gazebo-yarp-plugins are a set of Gazebo plugins that expose YARP interfaces 
for robot simulated in Gazebo. The main design objective for the gazebo-yarp-plugins 
is to provide the exact same interfaces that can be found in real world YARP-powered 
robot in the Gazebo simulation, to ensure that YARP-based software can run with no modifications
both in simulation and on the real robots.
