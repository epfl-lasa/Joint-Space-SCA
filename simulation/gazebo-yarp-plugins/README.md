gazebo-yarp-plugins [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins)
===================

The gazebo-yarp-plugins are a set of [Gazebo plugins](http://gazebosim.org/) that expose [YARP interfaces](http://yarp.it/)
for robot simulated in Gazebo. The main design objective for the gazebo-yarp-plugins
is to provide the exact same interfaces that can be found in real world YARP-powered
robot in the Gazebo simulation, to ensure that YARP-based software can run with no modifications
both in simulation and on the real robots.

For installing and using the plugins, check the [main page of the documentation](http://robotology.gitlab.io/docs/gazebo-yarp-plugins/master/).
